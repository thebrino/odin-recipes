    <p>
      This steak soup is an extremely hearty soup that only gets better in the
      fridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of the only soups you will not have to jazz up on your own, and
      people will remember you for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a great cold-weather soup, but my family requests it all year.
    </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds lean boneless beef round steak, cut into cubes</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>4 sprigs fresh parsley, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped celery leaves</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
      <li>1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups peeled, diced Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups sliced carrots</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups chopped celery</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the foam
        disappears from butter. Cook and stir beef and onion in butter-oil
        mixture until browned, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        While beef is cooking, mix together flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in
        a small bowl. Sprinkle flour mixture over browned beef; stir to coat and
        set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Pour beef broth and water into a large soup pot. Stir in parsley, celery
        leaves, bay leaf, and marjoram. Stir in beef mixture; bring to a boil.
        Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer, stirring
        occasionally, until meat is tender, about 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Mix in corn, potatoes, carrots, celery, and tomato paste. Bring to a
        simmer and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are
        tender and soup is thick, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove bay leaf and serve
        hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
