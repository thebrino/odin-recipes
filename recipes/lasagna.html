    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but
      my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and
      Parmesan.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.
    </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound
        ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
      </li>
      <li>
        Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed
      </li>
      <li>
        Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush
        one clove of garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the
        tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried
        basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for
        uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan.
        You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a
        binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high
        heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion
        and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
        garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and
        simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water
        to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
        and set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh
        parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a
        9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles
        over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of
        the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers
        once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and
        mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
        bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and
        serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
